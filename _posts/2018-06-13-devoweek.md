* **[How To Ensure Idempotency In An Eventual Consistent DDD/CQRS Application](http://blog.sapiensworks.com/post/2015/08/26/How-To-Ensure-Idempotency)**
* **[Go vs .NET Core in terms of HTTP performance](https://hackernoon.com/go-vs-net-core-in-terms-of-http-performance-7535a61b67b8)** - Go is much faster as a light HTTP server than ASP.NET Core
* DDD with EF
  * **[Data Points - DDD-Friendlier EF Core 2.0](https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/mt842503)** 
  * **[Data Points - DDD-Friendlier EF Core 2.0, Part 2](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt826347.aspx)**
  * **[Is the repository pattern useful with Entity Framework Core?](https://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/is-the-repository-pattern-useful-with-entity-framework-core/)**
    * Don't add another silly abstraction over your `DbContext`
    * You can still do your DDD, but you'll need to tie up ORM with Domain model unfortunetly.
    * For SRP you can use `IQueryable<>` extensions.
    * Unit testing should be done with InMemory DB
    * This article kind of connects to his thoughts: [Why Entity Framework renders the Repository pattern obsolete?](https://cockneycoder.wordpress.com/2013/04/07/why-entity-framework-renders-the-repository-pattern-obsolete/) 
  * **[Six ways to build better Entity Framework (Core and EF6) applications](https://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/six-ways-to-build-better-entity-framework-core-and-ef6-applications/)**
    * > There are lots of debates about whether EF Core is suitable for a DDD approach, because the business logic code is normally separate from the EF entity classes which it maps to the database. However, Eric Evans is pragmatic on this point and says in the section entitled “Working within your (database access) Frameworks” that, and I quote:
      >
      > “In general, don’t fight your framework. Seek ways to keep the fundamentals of domain-driven design and let go of the specifics when your framework is antagonistic”
Page 157, Domain-Driven Design, by Eric Evans, 2004.
