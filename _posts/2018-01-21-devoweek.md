This week:

* **[Two Ways to Do Async/Await in ASP.NET Wrong (and How to Fix Them)](https://exceptionnotfound.net/two-ways-to-do-async-await-in-asp-net-wrong-and-how-to-fix-them/)** - Two rules about async `Task.Run())`.
  * Don't do wrap async call with another task, ex: `Task.Run(() => client.GetServicesAsync(request));`
  * Don't put sync method call into async call ([async-over-sync](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pfxteam/2012/03/24/should-i-expose-asynchronous-wrappers-for-synchronous-methods/)): ` Task.Run(() => client.GetData(request));`
* **[Be careful in using the C# null conditional operators in tests ](https://www.productivecsharp.com/2018/01/careful-using-c-null-conditional-operators-tests/)** - Safe referencing nullable variable can make test pass even if it shouldn't.
  ```csharp
  // When result is null, the assertion will be skipped.
  result?.ToString().ShouldBe("...");
  
  // To be absolultly sure it's ok, we can do this instead
  result.ShouldNotBeNull();
  result.ToString().ShouldBe("...");
  ```
* **[Arrow](http://arrow-kt.io/)** - _Λrrow is a functional programming library for the Kotlin programming language born from the fusion of KΛTEGORY and funKTionale._
* **[Why Functional Programming Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB8jN68KGcU)** - Talk about FP fundamentals and why they matter.
* **[Programming Notes for Professionals books](http://goalkicker.com/)** - Set of notes for various topics.
