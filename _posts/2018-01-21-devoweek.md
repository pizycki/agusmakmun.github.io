  * Don't do wrap async call with another task, ex: `Task.Run(() => client.GetServicesAsync(request));`
  * Don't put sync method call into async call ([async-over-sync](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pfxteam/2012/03/24/should-i-expose-asynchronous-wrappers-for-synchronous-methods/)): ` Task.Run(() => client.GetData(request));`
