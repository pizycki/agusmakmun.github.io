I watch [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) courses since the very begining of my programming journey. If I remember well, my first I took was ASP.NET MVC 4, which was like a gift as I was about to start work in my very first serious work using this web framework.

Years pass by and I still come back to this awesome portal of great courses. I take them as a good tour through of differenet technologies. The courses focus on basics, rarly diving into more advanced topcis. This is good, beacuse you (and author) don't waste time on things that might never touch you.

>  But if you do look for some uncommon things, search for 'Advanced' courses.

Sometime I just need a general introduction to specific technology. Or a brief of upcoming changes in framework or platform. Pluralsight finds its place here very well.

## My list of favs

The links below are courses which interested me the most and which I recommend for everyone to watch. The order is random (maybe I'll categorise them in future).
