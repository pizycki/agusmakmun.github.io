### Go back or up

If you want go back to previous location where you were in explorer, click `Alt + ← `.

To go one folder up click `Alt + ↑`. That means, when you are inside `C:\Foo\Bar` folder, it will change directory to `C:\Foo`.

### Rename file

This one is allows for quick changing selected file name.

Just select one file and press `F2`, type in new file name and accept by pressing `Enter`.

This also works for other Microsoft programs, like [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com).

You can combine it with copying file name without using mouse: select file, enter edit name mode with `F2`, select whole name with `Ctrl+a`, copy it with `Ctrl+c` and paste it whenever you want with `Ctrl+v`. 

If you have set of files that make a sequence you can rename them all at once. Selecte them all, press `F2` and provide base name for those files. Each file will be named with base name and the following number.
I.e. `Base_Name (1)`, `Base_Name (2)`, ... , `Base_Name (n)`
This works great for your vacation images ;)

### Select file with keyboard

When you change your directory start typing name file you're looking for. If you type correctly it will be selected, even if you won't finish typing it's name.

### Undo

If make any move by accident, you can undo your changes by clicking `Ctrl+z`. It doesn't work always, but in most cases its worth trying!
