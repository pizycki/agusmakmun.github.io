## News

* **[Memeful Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MariusBancila.memefulcomments)** - Extension that will display linked images inside your methods (also tests!) describtion. You can finaly insert image of dragons into your tangled code. Great stuff!
* **[Moving CodePlex to read-only](https://codeplex.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Moving%20CodePlex%20to%20read-only)** - CodePlex dies slowly and user will no longer can add new code.
* **The simplest `.Aggregate()` example** - In my production code I only **once** used this LINQ method in the code that actualy finished in codebase. Reading [ploehs article about semigroups](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/11/27/semigroups/) I stumbled on the most practical and readable example of using `.Aggregate` (in Func. Prog. known widely as `fold`). Here it is
```
var a = new[] { 1, 0, 1337, -10, 42 }.Aggregate(Math.Min);
```
Trivial, yet much more sexy than ordinary `.Aggregate((a, b) => a < b ? a : b)`. And lovely presents idea of ~~[Strategy Design Pattern](https://www.google.pl/search?q=strategy+design+pattern)~~ [Higher-order function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function#C.23).

As mentioned in last post, I focused on automatition of bootstrapping branches for new DevoWeek posts. At first I tried doing this with Azure Logic Apps, but find out that GitHub integration API is **very** limitted (just creating/reacting to new issues).

I searched on Google looking for some example how can I create new branch on GitHub using its web API. Found [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Potherca/3964930), tried it and it worked, so, the second stateless option, Azure Functions.
