As mentioned in last post, I focused on automatition of bootstrapping branches for new DevoWeek posts. At first I tried doing this with Azure Logic Apps, but find out that GitHub integration API is **very** limitted (just creating/reacting to new issues).

I searched on Google looking for some example how can I create new branch on GitHub using its web API. Found [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Potherca/3964930), tried it and it worked, so, the second stateless option, Azure Functions.
