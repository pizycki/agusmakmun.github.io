This week:
* [**Why calling 'man' at 0:30 throws with error 'gimmie gimmie gimmie'?**](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/405783/why-does-man-print-gimme-gimme-gimme-at-0030) - Funny easter egg found in some testing library.
* **Select all MSSQL objects *touched* in last N days** - Short script taken from MSDN.
  I had an issue while creating new database table. When running a script, I was getting an error `There is already an object named 'TABLE_NAME' in the database.`. [Apex SQL Search](https://www.apexsql.com/sql_tools_search.aspx) failed finding anything with that name, but this script saved my sanity.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT name AS object_name   
    ,SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) AS schema_name  
    ,type_desc  
    ,create_date  
    ,modify_date  
  FROM sys.objects  
  WHERE modify_date > GETDATE() - 1  -- N := 1
  ORDER BY modify_date;  
  GO  
  ```
  
* **Balbla** - Some content
