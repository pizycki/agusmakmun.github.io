After short break with DevoWeek - it's back!

This week:

* **[Command line "tab" completion for .NET Core CLI in PowerShell or bash](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/CommandLineTabCompletionForNETCoreCLIInPowerShellOrBash.aspx)** - 
* **[Domain-Driven Design: Working with Legacy Projects](http://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/2018/03/28/new-course-domain-driven-design-working-legacy-projects/)** - As fan of Khorikov posts and podcasts, I will definitly watch this course as well as others.
* **[The Maybe functor](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2018/03/26/the-maybe-functor/)** - Ploeh writies about mona... functors !
* **[F# and the functional SAFE Stack with Krzysztof CieÅ›lak and Scott Hanselman](https://hanselminutes.com/624/f-and-the-functional-safe-stack-with-krzysztof-cielak)**
* **[Reinventing MVC pattern for web programming with F#](http://kcieslak.io/Reinventing-MVC-for-web-programming-with-F)** - Introducing Saturn
  * _strongly inspired by some concepts from Phoenix_ 
  * _...can be put on top of any existing Giraffe application..._
  * _...tooling for scaffolding new projects, generating controllers, models, database layer and migration scripts, controlling database migrations etc._
* **[Code Foresting](https://slides.com/sebastiangebski/code-foresting-in-action)** - Great talk about integrating international team and how to introduce code quality tools. 
* **[Pose](https://github.com/tonerdo/pose)** - .NET shimming library. Replace static class calls with `delegate` instances. Great for dealing with legacy systems (which has no Dependency Injection) and reproducing production environment bugs.
  ```csharp
  using Pose;

  Shim dateTimeShim = Shim.Replace(() => DateTime.Now).With(() => new DateTime(2004, 4, 4));
  ```
  
What happens when I program in functional way in mainly object oriented dev team.
