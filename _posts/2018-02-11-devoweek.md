This week:

* **[ASP .Net Core 2.1 features](https://neelbhatt.com/2018/02/06/asp-net-core-2-1-features/)**
  * New SignalR in ASP.NET Core
  * Add HSTS support
  * Rich Swagger support
  * _"Asp .Net Core Module is the module which lets you run ASP.NET Core applications on IIS."_
* **[dotnet-env](https://github.com/tonerdo/dotnet-env)** - you can know it from JS world. This small library susbtitutes environment variables on the program start. This is very helpful feature while dealing with many deployment environments. I use it in my [PagiNET](http://githbu.com/pizycki/PagiNET) project where I get configuration for integration tests, setting up a database and so on. This is much better than dealing with `*.config` files.
* **[Item]()** -
