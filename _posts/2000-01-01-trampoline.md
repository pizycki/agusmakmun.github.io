Recursion v Tail Recursion

## Origin of strugle is 
Becoming Functional book, chapter about tail recursion in Java, Scala and Groovy

## Support
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/491376/why-doesnt-net-c-optimize-for-tail-call-recursion
tail call optimization is supported by CLR
tail call optimization is not supported by C#
64bit jitter (??) supports it

## Examples

need a sample? sum numbers up to 1000

imperative example 
simple recursion in C# (how do you even declare rec func in C#)
simple recursion in C#, but with 64 bit JIT
recursion in F#
