I was on vacation, that's why there was a break. I'm back and DevoWeek is back too.

This week:

* **[A JSON Data Context Driver for LINQPad](http://ryandavis.io/a-json-data-context-driver-for-linqpad/)** - If you have to run some queries against large JSON object **and** you like [LinqPad](http://www.linqpad.net/), [this driver](https://github.com/rdavisau/jsondatacontext-linqpad) is best choice for you! [Here](http://forum.linqpad.net/discussion/566/how-to-install-plug-ins) you have manual how to use `*.lpx` file, downloaded from GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/rdavisau/jsondatacontext-linqpad/releases).
* **[Tee (command)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_(command))** - _tee is normally used to split the output of a program so that it can be both displayed and saved in a file._
  
  Example in C#
  
  ```csharp
  void Main()
  {
    DateTime actualTime = DateTime.Now.Tee(time => Console.WriteLine(time));
    
    // it will print actual time and assaign it to `actualTime` variable
  }

  public static class TeeExtension{
    public static T Tee<T>(this T @target, Action<T> fn) {
      if (@target == null) 
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(@target));

      fn(@target);

      return @target;
    }
  }
  ```
* **[FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)** - Font designed for programmers, it turns `!=`, `=>`, `->` and other specific for C-like or functional languages to more be more human readable. 
* **[Rico's cheatsheets](https://devhints.io/)**
