This week:

* **[newman: the cli companion for postman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman)** - I needed a tool that I could test API. In ideal scenario this would happen also during CI build. And I found this tool. Being familiar with [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) I easly wrote my first tests using [examples on Postman site](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/test_examples). It's really simple. There is also a [Cake addon](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Newman) to integrate newman in Cake build.
