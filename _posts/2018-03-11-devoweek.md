This week:

* **[Why GitHub Won't Help You With Hiring](https://www.benfrederickson.com/github-wont-help-with-hiring/)** - Some really interesting facts and thoughts presented. Worth reading. Although, the article doesn't mean ~~open source~~ sharing is not good. It only states that GitHub profile won't give you job. Personaly, I had only one job offer where the recruiter said that he **saw** my github profile (and it was true).
* **[What’s new for the Command Line in Windows 10 version 1803](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/03/07/windows10v1803/)**
   * Kali Linux and Debian for WSL
   * Background Tasks in WSL
   * Unix Sockets (_"One of the great things about this is it enables WSL to run the Linux Docker Client to interact with the Docker Daemon running on Windows."_)
   * OpenSSH-based client and server
   * Tar and Curl with Windows 10
* **[Web Apps can’t really do *that*, can they?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G8HEDI3K6s)**
  * Service Workers (in browsers)
  * Web Assembly and Blazor
  * Cross platform credential manager (in browser obviously)
  * Native UI for request payments
