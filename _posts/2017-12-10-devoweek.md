This week:

* **[dotnet-script 0.16 is out](https://www.strathweb.com/2017/12/c-repl-for-net-core-2-0-and-load-support-from-nuget-0-16-dotnet-script-is-out/)** - I haven't written in DevoWeek about scripted C# on .NET Core, so here it is. Also check out [project site](https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-script).
* **[Stubbing your way to automated end to end testing in an API first world](https://alastaircrabtree.com/stubbing-your-way-to-automated-e2e-testing-api-first-with-wiremock/)** - A blog post about stubbing your 3rd party systems in E2E tests with [WireMock.NET](https://github.com/WireMock-Net/WireMock.Net). Good read.
* **[Over 5 Years of F#](http://jnyman.com/2017/12/04/five_years_of_fsharp/)** - Story of some developer from Arizona that started with Excel addons and ended up as F#(+C#) developer. He wrote about his history and what are his thoughts. Really cool post.
