## DevoWeek
Works on *continous post deployment* are still going. As I mentioned in the last post, I dropped idea of manualy creating HTTP requests for using [octokit.NET](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net). The choice turned out to be great. Development speeded up dramaticly as octokit.net is well documented and I can fully focus on learning F#, not worring about some GitHub API limitations.

Work goes well, but there is much *unknown* yet to be found.
