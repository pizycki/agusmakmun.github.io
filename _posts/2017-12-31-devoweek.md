This week:

* **[Netflix: What Happens When You Press Play?](http://highscalability.com/blog/2017/12/11/netflix-what-happens-when-you-press-play.html)** - Very interesting article about how **big** services manage to handle massive popularity and being top3 video streaming platforms. Semi-technical, but very well narrated.
  Some notes taken (all are quatations)
  * _Netflix plays more than 1 billion hours of video each week. As a comparison, YouTube streams 1 billion hours of video every day while Facebook streams 110 million hours of video every day._
  * _Netflix uses two different clouds: AWS and Open Connect._
  * _Netflix launched in 1998. At first they rented DVDs through the US Postal Service._
  * _Netflix uses both DynamoDB and Cassandra_
  * _...the image shown for each video is selected specifically for you. Not everyone sees the same image."_
  * _Remember, Netflix records and counts everything you do on their site._ This is actualy good, cuz it can learn what you like and suggest you content more precisly. 
* **[Performance Considerations for EF 4, 5, and 6](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh949853(v=vs.113).aspx)** - found on [Entity Framework – improve query performance – potential problems](http://devmate.net/2017/12/entity-framework-improve-query-performance-potential-problems/)
