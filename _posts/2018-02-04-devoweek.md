* **[Functional architecture is Ports and Adapters](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2016/03/18/functional-architecture-is-ports-and-adapters/)** - This is long, but when you're FP maniac, you easly can dive in.
* **[What service metrics should be monitored?](https://piotr.westfalewicz.com/blog/2018/01/what-service-metrics-should-be-monitored/)** - For measuring those metrics using [Warden](https://github.com/warden-stack/Warden) might be a good choice.
