This week:

* **[EF Core 2.1 Roadmap: Views, Group By, and Lazy Loading](https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/02/EF-Core-2.1-Road-Map)** - I work with EF Core in my current project and I really miss some of those features. Good to see they're comming "soon".

* **[Machine Learning Crash Course
with TensorFlow APIs..](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/)**
