## Fsharp

First time I saw functional programming in action was at Warsaw .NET user group with ... presentation called WTF#. It was cool, but to be honest I was more hyped about new language that looks very exotic and works on .NET.

For an exeperiment I did a small [assignment project]() using little of F#, but it was no functional at all. It was simply written (poorly) in object-oriented manner.

I came back to OOP world.

## Functional Csharp

Next moment with FP was again at WG.NET. This time it was Marcin Malinowski and "Functional Toys in Object-oriented sandbox" ([Funkcyjne zabawki w obiektowej piaskownicy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwhbON9B76w)).
